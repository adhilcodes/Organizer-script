# Organizer-script

This is a basic bash automation script to organize my downloads folder.This Script will organize Audio, Video, Image... files in differant format/extensions in to respective folders.

## Why this?
Now our downloads folder is a mess, so naturally, instead of spending 5 minutes organizing it, it will be nice if we spent 30 minutes writing a bash script to organize it.

## How Setup in your PC

1) Move this file into your downloads folder 

    `cd Downloads`

2) Run the script

    `./organizer`
